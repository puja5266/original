Q1:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
 all your work local?

Ans: When I have a working version of my code hat i am ready to share 
and which will be helpful for other.

Q2:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
 having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: Pulling changes give a control to us as we can decide wat changes
 wewant to have and wat we dont. when we are working on some feature 
we dont want github to interfere and automatically upadetes that might 
not even run.

Q3:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Ans: We use branches when we are creating diffenent commits.
        We use clone when we ant to have a copy of our repository or file in
         either local machine or clone it from github.
        We use fork when we want to copy project directly into my gitthub 
       account fom other account anf make minor changes on github.

Q4:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

Ans: benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally is to avoid conflit and to know the state which 
will help while merging.
